						<p class="mb-2">Tenerife is the largest of the seven stunning Canary Islands, which form this Atlantic Ocean archipelago. From the golden sandy beaches in the south to the dramatic lunar landscape of Mount Teide National Park and everything in between, Tenerife is a must see.</p>
						<p class="mb-2">The Canary Islands are part of a community of Island chains situated in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. Along with Madeira, Cape Verde, the Azores and the Savage Islands, the Canaries are known as Macaronesia which literally translates as ‘Islands of the Fortunate’. The Canary Islands certainly are fortunate as they boast over 1700 species of plants and an assortment of animal, insect and marine life and out of the seven Canary Islands, Tenerife is the most biologically diverse due to its extraordinary climate and geography.</p>
						<p class="mb-2">This little Island is home to two world heritage sites, one national park, the world’s third largest volcano and forty-two natural protected spaces making it jam packed with places to explore. The enormous variety of activities and sites such as the medieval castle, unspoilt villages and fantastic diving will make your time in Tenerife a truly unique experience. </p>
						<p class="mb-2">As one of the top whale and dolphin watching destinations in the world, the south-west coast of Tenerife is a truly outstanding location for the observation of free-living whales. There are resident communities of pilot whales and dolphins which remain here throughout the year, which can be observed on perhaps 80% of the days of the year. There is also a total of 24 other species migrating through Canarian waters at different times of the year from the giant blue whale to the majestic killer whale.</p>
						<p class="mb-2">This project will give you the perfect opportunity to learn more about these fascinating creatures and gain valuable experience in conservation as you spend your days working alongside the Island’s threatened whale and dolphin populations.</p>

						<p class="mb-2">As a volunteer on the Marine Research &amp; Whale Shark Conservation Project you will help carry out the marine research and monitoring activities for the project under the guidance of our co-ordinating project scientists. You will join other volunteers on the project to collect the data via scuba dives, ocean safaris, and beach walks off the coastline of Tofo in Mozambique. You can expect an excellent diving, snorkelling and beach experience whilst gaining first hand marine research skills and contributing to a worthwhile project.</p>
						<p class="mb-2">As a volunteer you will help on a multitude of research projects. These include monitoring of whale shark numbers, behaviour and ecology and taking underwater identification photographs; monitoring the condition of coral reefs and indicator species of reef fish. You will also be trained to take ID photos of manta rays and other threatened marine species to aid population assessment and monitoring. At certain times of the year you may help survey humpback whale numbers and turtle nesting activity as well as other indicators of the health of marine biodiversity. You may also assist with beach clean-ups and other general environmental activities, and will help upload and analyse the field data.</p>
						<p class="mb-2">Some of the activities you will get involved in may include:</p>
						<p class="mb-2">Whale Shark (throughout the year) The whale shark component of the Project involves joining ocean safaris to snorkel with Whale Sharks in the open ocean. It involves taking underwater photographs for identifying the Whale Sharks as well as recording other ecological information. As a summary, you will collect the following information on the Whale Sharks:</p>
						<ul class="volunteer_list">
							<li>Date, GPS location, surface and underwater conditions Size, sex, scars/distinctive features, behaviour of the whale shark</li>
							<li>You will take an ID photograph and identify each whale shark &amp; record re-sightings Dolphin (throughout the year)</li>
							<li>Another species monitored on ocean safaris are dolphins.</li>
							<li> You will be collecting data which enables dolphin numbers and behaviours to be recorded and uploaded onto databases to share with our Marine Partners of particular interest in this study is dolphin behaviour in relation to tourism</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="mb-2">Coral Reef and Fish (throughout the year) The coral reef monitoring involves joining scuba diving and carrying out underwater data collection on indicator species of coral fish and the condition and cover of coral and echinoderms on the reefs. As a summary, on these research dives you may carry out the following activities:</p>
						<ul class="volunteer_list">
							<li>Recording indicator species of reef fish</li>
							<li>Collect ID photos of megafauna including mantas, turtles and leopard sharks</li>
							<li>Coral reef quadrants to assess the cover and condition of different coral groups and echinoderms</li>
							<li>Collection of photos of nudibranches (sea slugs) to help develop a species list for Mozambique</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Turtles (November to March)</h5> 
							<p class="mb-2">You may help survey turtle survival and you may be lucky enough from November to February to monitor nesting of turtles on beaches in the areas around Tofo. Historically, loggerhead turtles have nested here in significant numbers and although these, as well as green turtles, leatherback turtles and hawksbill turtles, are sighted in-water, their nesting has declined dramatically owing to poaching. In the last 8 years, little to no nests have been found in the area. The surveys involve working to patrol the beaches, recording nest sites, finding shells- sizing them and taking a GPS points for data collection on poaching in the area.</p>
						<h5>Seahorses (throughout the year) </h5>
						<p class="mb-2">This project will involve travelling to the nearby Inhambane Estuary and snorkling in relatively shallow waters to evaluate and monitor the seahorse population. The seahorses are counted, and photos taken to identify size of the seahorses, and data then entered into a database to allow for analysis.</p>
						<h5>Humpback Whales (June – October) </h5>
						<p class="mb-2">You may help monitor the numbers of humpbacked whales on their seasonal migration up and down the coast. This involves sand dune based observations using binoculars and boat based observations recording the numbers of whales, the makeup of the pods and behaviours witnessed.</p>

						<p class="mb-2">The ORCA Foundation volunteer program officially started in 2001, and is designed to increase awareness about conservation issues and initiatives, and to help create a conservation model for the Plettenberg Bay area. People of all ages and with different backgrounds come from all over the world to learn while helping us further our work in sustaining marine and coastal resources. </p>
						<p class="mb-2">Our programs are both sea and land based, and daily activities include whale and dolphin watching, elasmobranch egg case surveys (in collaboration with ELMO), fin profiling for animal movement studies, hikes and walks, marine debris clean-ups, planting indigenous trees and removing alien species, White Shark monitoring project (in collaboration with the Plett Hope Spot), river health assessments, and education of preschool children. </p>
						<p class="mb-2">Besides our education and research work, we are also involved with various other conservation activities. Such activities include maintenance of the Ocean Blue aquarium, which holds a collection of fish and represents the ecosystem of the surrounding bay. We collect food for the fish, clean the aquarium, facilitate water changes, and collect specimens for the aquarium, while at the same time learning about the rivers, estuaries, the sea, and the delicate balance between all of them. Your time with us can be as short as two weeks or can last as long as you want!</p>
						<p class="mb-2">The number of volunteers can range anywhere from 1 to 12, depending on the season and number of bookings made, with no more than 4 people in one room.</p>
						<p class="mb-2">If you have a passion for marine and coastal wildlife and ecosystems, a longing to learn, a desire to help the less fortunate, and a general love for work/adventure, ORCA Foundation is the answer for you!</p>
						
						<h5>Activities</h5>
						<p class="mb-2">Our program comprises 3 key elements:</p>
						<p>Conservation: Rescue of marine birds, assist with beach strandings, stabilization of turtles prior to them being moved onto specialized facilities, alien tree removal, beach clean-ups</p>
						<p class="mb-2">Education: Partaking in pre-school and primary school environmental education programs, educational entertainment through the media of dance and theatre, partnering with a local under-privileged preschool to teach English and assist where needed</p>
						<p class="mb-2">Research: Taking and processing fin profile photos of a number of whale and dolphin species seen on boat trips, analysing river health, bird ringing, elasmobranch surveys, contributing to a number of online databases mapping species distribution</p>
						<p class="mb-2">ORCA Foundation combines conservation, education, research, community development, and tourism into its comprehensive volunteer program. It’s all hands-on! All activities depend on season, weather, and need, and as such may be subject to change throughout the year. As a result all placements are different, and you may or may not be involved with the above activities. Volunteers can also expect to contribute to Ocean Blue Adventures’ commercial operations. Bad weather days can delay conservation/research activities and may involve indoor activities and courses.</p>
						
						<h5>GPS monitoring on dolphin and whale watching trips</h5>
						<p class="mb-2">Besides giving the volunteers the opportunity to see these magnificent marine-creatures in their natural habitat, we use this chance to record details as to what, where and when. What did we see, where were they sighted, when did we see them? Photos are also taken for the purpose of fin-profiling.</p>
						
						<h5>Elasmobranch egg-case project</h5>
						<p class="mb-2">Elasmobranchs are a group comprising sharks, rays, and skates, and some of these lay eggs. Each beach is surveyed bimonthly and egg cases GPSed and collected. These egg cases are identified, analysed and measured after soaking in water for at least 12 hours.</p>
						
						<h5>Bird Ringing</h5>
						<p class="mb-2">Minke Witteveen is a licenced bird ringer which provides the ORCA Foundation with the opportunity to engage in the uncommon activity of capturing local birds in specialised nets. A metal ring with a unique alphanumeric code is placed on each birds leg, and a variety of morphometric measurements are taken. All these data are uploaded to a central data base managed by SAfring. This allows for data on movements, longevity, changes in timing of biological processes, and other data to be collected.</p>
						
						<h5>MiniSASS: River Health Assessement</h5>
						<p class="mb-2">Macroinvertebrates living in the river are collected by drawing a net through the water and surrounding vegetation. Individuals caught are identified, and based on the sensitivity score of the groups they belong to, the relative health of the river can be assessed. These results are uploaded to an online database monitoring river health throughout South Africa.</p>
						
						<h5>Siyakula Pre-School</h5>
						<p class="mb-2">Based in the Qolweni Township, Siyakula Pre-school educates over 100 children. Once a week the volunteers assist at Siyakula by giving a 45 minute lesson, which the volunteers themselves prepare and implement, and has included a variety of topics. Thereafter they read a story and play games with the children. They also help serve and clean-up after lunch. Volunteers are able to help a disadvantaged community, and are exposed to a different culture.</p>
						
						<h3>Our Location</h3>
						<p class="mb-2">The ORCA house will be your temporary home, and is located minutes away from the beach and steps away from the estuary. Transportation for ORCA-related activities will be provided by ORCA staff in our vehicle. Plettenberg Bay (fondly Plett) is located in the Western Cape in the heart of the Garden Route. We are 210km from Port Elizabeth and 600km from Cape Town, and just a short 84 km from George Airport.</p>

						<p class="mb-2"><i>“Walk away with professional diving certifications and amazing experiences in one of the world's’ most beautiful marine environment!”</i></p>
						<p class="mb-2">Samana Bay is a significant breeding ground and nursery area for humpback whales from all over the North Atlantic and the most important multi-species fishing ground in the DR. While tourism is an important economic activity its impact on sensitive coastal-marine ecosystems is of particular concern. A major portion of environmental degradation in coastal areas is attributed to large-scale hotel developments in areas of high biodiversity and unregulated tour activities put at risk reproduction sites for whales and turtles. Mangrove deforestation and coral reef damage in turn decrease the resilience of these coastal marine ecosystems and increase their vulnerability to tropical storms. Additionally destructive lionfish (Pterois volitans) are invading coral reefs in the Americas and has been identified as one of the world’s greatest conservation issues. Our program is part of an effort to tackle an invasive species and help reverse coral reef damage!</p>
						
						<h3>What to expect</h3>
						<p class="mb-2">First gain "Open Water" and than "Under Water Ecologist" speciality diving skills and certifications while assisting dive instructors in their day to day work at a busy local diving center &amp; school. Once you have acquired the necessary skills and qualifications a few weeks into the internship you will then additionally assist with marine environmental restoration activities, species protection &amp; monitoring activities as well as invasive-species control as. All seaborne diving activities depend greatly on weather patterns and sea conditions and often require changes of plans on short notice. This is a great opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to the protection of the marine environment while at the same time becoming a passionate qualified diver and learn to master everyday challenges at a busy diving center working side by side with fellow interns &amp; students, diving clients, dive masters and the chief instructor.
