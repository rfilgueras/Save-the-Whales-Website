							<p>The animals are routinely rounded up and butchered in cold blood over the course of a year as part of ‘tradition’. One of the mass culls happens every summer, with thousands of pilot and beaked whales meeting their maker in bays across the Danish-owned Faroe Islands.</p>
							<p>Sickening images show fishermen steering herds into the shallow waters, stained red by the blood of slain animals which have come before them. One whale can be seen fighting for its life as three men drag it through the water. Other revelers use ropes to drag the whales’ bodies into the shore as punters watch on the beach. All in all, this particular horror show lasted a total of an hour and a half, with 180 whales stripped of their lives.</p>
							<p>The Faroese have eaten pilot whale meat and blubber since they first settled in the islands over a century ago. According to the official Faroe Islands tourist site, the whale drive is a community activity open to all, well organized on a community level and regulated by national laws. Records of all pilot whale hunts have been kept since 1584. The practice, they believe, is sustainable, as there are an estimated whopping 778,000 whales in the eastern North Atlantic region. On average, 100,000 swim close to the Faroe Islands, and the Faroese hunt on average 800 pilot whales each year.</p>
							<p>The meat and blubber from the hunt is distributed equally among those who’ve participated. Those who are too ill or weak to take part are encouraged to sign up for their share, even though they’ve not taken part. Hunting and killing methods have been ‘improved’, they say, to ensure as little harm to the whales as possible. All hunters must now obtain a hunting license in order to kill a whale. Although pilot whale meat and blubber contains protein, iron, carnitine and vitamins, there are concerns the high levels of mercury and PCBs in the whales can have negative health effects.</p>
							<p>Ocean pollution by heavy industries and industrialized agriculture has resulted in the pollution of these animals.</p>

							<p>NORWAY has angered activists by announcing an increase in whale hunting quotas. The country hopes to trigger a revival in the industry, which has seen a reduction in the number of hunters. It has agreed a 28 per cent increase of its annual whaling quota to 1,278 whales.</p>
							<p>In recent years, Norway’s whalers have failed to catch the quotas set by Oslo and the number of whaling boats has plummeted. Its government hopes that by raising the quota, more whalers will take to the waters. Per Sandberg, the fisheries minister, said: “I hope the quota and the merging of fishing zones will be a good starting point for a good season for the whaling industry.</p>
							<p>Norway is one of just two countries in the world to authorize whaling. The other is Iceland. Japan still hunts whales but officially it kills the marine mammals for the purposes of scientific research. In reality, much of the whale meat ends up being eaten, with whale being relatively commonplace in restaurants.</p>
							<p>Norway, whose whaling today is limited to the minke whale, refuses to abide by a 1986 international hunting moratorium, which it formally opposed. After a brief pause, Norway resumed its minke whale hunt in 1993, saying that it considered stocks sufficiently high. According to Oslo, there are now more than 100,000 minkes in Norwegian waters.</p>
							<p>From around 350 whaling vessels in Norway in 1950, the numbers plunged to 11 in 2017, almost 50 percent down from the previous year. The number of whales killed has also dropped, from 660 in 2015 to 432 last year.</p>
							<p>In 2017, the quota was 999—the “lowest in many years,” according to Mr Sandberg. Whaling professionals say that their failure to meet the annual quotas is due to insufficient capacity of whale meat processing plants and rising fuel prices. Whales are also more elusive as they swim to colder and remoter waters due to global warming. A spokesman for Whale and Dolphin Conservation said: “The popularity of whale meat is falling and hunts rely on state subsidies. The government is constantly searching for new markets to exploit.”</p>
							<p>“There is no humane way to kill a whale at sea. Many die a slow, painful death. This slaughter is unnecessary, uneconomical, unquestionably cruel and pointless.”</p>

							<p>Like fishermen, whale hunters sometimes alter the details of their catch. In the 1960s, Soviet Union (USSR) whalers illegally killed almost 180,000 cetaceans, but reported taking far lower numbers. Now, it seems that Japanese whalers in the North Pacific also manipulated their numbers around this time, according to a new study. The finding, which comes as Japan is readying to hunt whales for what it says are research purposes, raises new concerns about the country’s current endeavors; it also may invalidate several past studies on whale demographics and conservation, the authors say.</p>
							<p>“It’s really nice investigative work,” says Andrew Brierley, a marine ecologist at the University of St Andrews in the United Kingdom, “They’ve shown that the Japanese whalers added a fudge factor to make it appear that the whales they took were at the legal size [for hunting], when in all likelihood, they probably weren’t.”</p>
							<p>The false Japanese data have only come to light because of the previous discovery of the USSR’s fake reports. Both countries—along with all other whaling nations—began submitting catch statistics, including the sex and length of killed whales, to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1946. The organization, which oversees the global conservation and management of whales, specified where each country could hunt and the number and species of whales that they could take. Member nations also agreed to carry biologists on board whaling vessels to collect the catch data.</p>
							<p>But in 1948 the USSR went rogue and began hunting whales illegally. Over the next 30 years, its whaling industry killed an estimated 178,811 more cetaceans than it reported to IWC. Fortunately, four Soviet biologists kept secret, correct records, which were declassified in the 1990s.</p>
							<p>In 2007, Yulia Ivashchenko and Phillip Clapham, cetacean experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, Washington, joined their colleagues and one of the former Soviet (now Russian) biologists to adjust IWC’s records using the real Soviet whaling data. They discovered that the USSR hadn’t only engaged in illegal killing, but it had also ignored whaling regulations, particularly those pertaining to the sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus.</p>
							<p>Because this species had been heavily hunted for its oil since the late 1700s, IWC ruled that only sperm whales longer than 11.6 meters could be killed. (Male sperm whales may reach 20 meters in length, and females attain a maximum size of only 14 meters.) But the USSR whalers brushed aside this regulation, falsifying female lengths or recording females as larger males. “They did it so there wouldn’t be a discrepancy between the catch figures and the [whale] oil they collected,” Ivashchenko says, explaining that male sperm whales produce more oil.</p>
							<p>While interviewing the Russian scientists, Ivashchenko got a tip. “Several people said, ‘Oh, the Japanese did the same thing.’ But there was no evidence.” Finally, in 2002 a retired Japanese whaling station manager admitted that the country’s coastal whaling stations had regularly falsified their data, even after the 1986 whaling moratorium went into effect.</p>
							<p>To find out if the country’s pelagic fleets had also turned in fake data, Ivashchenko and Clapham turned to the now correct Soviet reports. They focused on the two countries’ catches of sperm whales, because the Japanese and Soviets were often hunting the marine mammals in the same area at the same time. In their real records, the Soviets reported having a “hard time to find legally-sized sperm whales,” Ivashchenko says. “Yet the Japanese were getting their quota each year—even though they were spending less time hunting. So, come on! These numbers are just not real.”</p>
							<p>The scientists’ close comparison of the two countries’ 1968 and 1969 sperm whale hunts revealed just how unreal the Japanese reports were. Over those 2 years, the Japanese whaling fleets in the North Pacific reported harpooning 1568 females. Of these, 1525—or 97.3%—were listed as being at or above IWC’s minimum length requirement. In contrast, the real Soviet data show that their whalers (who were hunting in the same area as the Japanese) killed 12,578 females—yet only 824 (or 6.6%) were the legal size. The doctored Japanese records report that their fleet even managed to catch 141 females in 1969 that were 12.5 meters or longer; that same year, the Soviets harpooned 5680 females, and only two of them were such a large size.</p>
							<p>After 1972, when IWC required whalers to have independent observers on board, the Japanese reported catching far fewer large female sperm whales or those of the minimum size, Ivashchenko and Clapham report today in Royal Society Open Science.</p>
							<p>Discovering that the Japanese whaling data for sperm whales is likely fabricated opens a can of worms, says John Frizell, a spokesman with Greenpeace in the United Kingdom. “Current population estimates and conservation depend on accurate historical data.” And, notes Clapham, “these fake data are in the IWC catch database; researchers use it. How many studies are now invalid because of this?” He, Ivashchenko, and others also suspect that if the Japanese whalers falsified their sperm whale catch data, then they likely submitted inaccurate reports on humpback and fin whales, too.</p>
							<p>So far, no one in Japan has stepped forward to help correct the data as the Russian biologists did. Joji Morishita, the director-general for the National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries in Tokyo and a delegate to IWC, says that he “welcome[s] any scientific work for the purpose of correcting past catch reports” in an email to Science (which he stresses represents his views and not necessarily those of his agency or of Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research, which oversees its whaling programs.) But he seems to think that the new paper only indicates “there was misreporting by the USSR in the past.”</p>
							<p>Frizell notes that the Japanese delegation gave similar responses at the recent IWC meeting in San Diego, California, where Ivashchenko presented an earlier version of the paper. “This stonewalling over something that happened over 40 years ago raises concerns on whether we can trust Japan’s current whaling data,” he says.</p>
							<p>He’s not alone in his suspicions. C. Scott Baker, a conservation geneticist at Oregon State University, discovered in 2001 that the Japanese regularly underreport the number of whales killed as bycatch. He notes that “the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling did not put an end to Japanese whaling or the misreporting of catches.”</p>
							<p>And that means that if the Japanese eventually persuade IWC member nations to reinstate commercial whaling, then there “must be absolutely independent observers on factory ships and in the marketplace” Clapham says. “We know what happens without observers. People cheat.”</p>

							<p>(CNN) — Japan has announced its withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) next year, and will resume commercial hunting in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone from July. It will also cease whaling activities in the Antarctic Ocean, according to an official statement released Wednesday, and hunt species with so-called “healthy” population numbers.</p>
							<p>“In its long history, Japan has used whales not only as a source of protein but also for a variety of other purposes,” the statement said. “Engagement in whaling has been supporting local communities, and thereby developed the life and culture of using whales.”</p>
							<p>The move to resume commercial whaling drew criticism from conservation groups and governments.</p>
							<p>“The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures,” said Sam Annesley, executive director at Greenpeace Japan. “The government of Japan must urgently act to conserve marine ecosystems, rather than resume commercial whaling.” Australia called Japan’s decision to withdraw from the IWC “regrettable” and urged Japan to return to the convention as a “matter of priority,” in a statement released Wednesday.</p>
							<p>Commercial whaling was banned under a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium. But Japan has used a loophole to continue hunting whales legally since 1987 for what it claims is scientific research.</p>
							<p>Iceland and Norway object to the moratorium and continue to hunt whales commercially without relying on science as an excuse. In September 2018, the majority of member nations at the IWC annual symposium in Brazil approved a non-binding resolution stating that commercial whaling was no longer a valid economic activity, or needed for scientific research.While the Japanese political class has sought the resumption of commercial whaling activities, campaigners say eating whale is becoming “less and less popular.”</p>
							<p>“Actually many (regular) people don’t have any interest in whales or whaling now in Japan,” Nanami Kurasawa of the Iruka and Kujira (dolphin and whale) Action Network (IKAN) told CNN.</p>
